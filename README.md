# Defence-Mechanism-Using-Image-Processing
Project created as part of an IIT Bombay's e-Yantra Ideas Competition, a national level project competition sponsored by MHRD, Government of India.

This project demonstrated a prototype model of an autonomous surveillance bot that could provide security in high profile areas where human intervention is not preferred.

Traditional defense systems include the presence of guards or CCTVs on the field. These methods have proven to be sloppy since human negligence or delays in the response time could not be completely eliminated. This prototype was developed to detect and/or track a potential threat without compromising the accuracy, durability and speed.
